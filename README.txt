UniCalc

User input should have a space between each character as such on all options:
68 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 74 68 69 73 20 69 73 20 61 20 74 65 73 74 20 73 74 72 69 6e 67

This script will convert hex, dec, oct, and binary to text on options A-D.
It will also convert from text to hex, dec, oct, and binary.

If your text or encrypted message does not convert or has any problem, make sure you don't have a bunch of space at the beginning of your input.

Some options need "inputtext.txt" as a buffer too enumerate the string you have provided. 

It does not need "Uni.txt", Insted I left it as a backup of the ascii banner in case needed.
